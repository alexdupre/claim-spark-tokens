# Spark Tokens Claiming Tool

A tool to claim the Spark tokens on the Flare network.

A demo is available here: https://alexdupre.github.io/claim-spark-tokens/

To test it you can generate new ripple test credentials here: https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html

This was a fun project to try scala.js, use it at your own risk.
